# Flappy-Bird

## code used
Python with pygame library. This game was a method for me to learn various library functions of Pygame such as SRCALPHA and Masking(in terms of passing and collisions. Once efficiently written, will sort out filing the object classes separately as for now there are some issues with importing few files from one to the other.

## images and audios

Assets file contains the necessary images and audios to replicate the flappy bird game: the number texts which is converted to string from integer, and the wing, point and hit audio.

## controls

Space to jump
Escape to restart when the game ends

## Further updates

For self entertainment purposes, change of images and audios can be implemented with various dimensions
